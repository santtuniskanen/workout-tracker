# Workout Tracker

Workout tracker is a personal project of mine, to track my strength training
workouts. I might expand the application further in the future to include other sports I like doing, such as hiking and cycling.

I'm kind of utilizing this application as a sandbox for those technologies I find interesting at the moment. 
Currently I'm interested in Swift and Go, which I will be using to create the iOS and MacOS applications and the Backend API. In the future I'm going to be writing a C# WinUI version of this application for my desktop computer.
